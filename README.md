# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
AutosRUs is an automobile company that plans to update its decision-making model, therefore a group of data analysts was assembled to carry out this task.

The team of data analysts will be in charge of analysis of historical data, analytical verification and validation of current automobile specifications. For this challenge, using the "R" programming language, summary statistics for different variables, visualizations for different datasets and high-quality interpretation of statistical test results will be performed in order to propose hypothesis and analysis for the AutosRUs executive team.

All that being said, for this module, the challenge will consist of:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
